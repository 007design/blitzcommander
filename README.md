## The story
A long time ago I built a Heavy Gear Blitz army construction application in Java called BlitzCommander. I also did the layout for several books from the Locked & Loaded version of the game. Unfortunately, my working relationship with DP9 ended before BlitzCommander was every fully finished. (I had to get a real job and afterwards I no longer had the time to devote to the project.)

Time went by and DP9 soldiered on. When they released the 3.0 version of the rules my interest was piqued and I started following Heavy Gear Blitz again.

**Short version:** I thought it was finally time that I learn TypeScript and React but I needed a project to build. I couldn't think of a better project than to resurrect BlitzCommander. It was a fun program the first time
