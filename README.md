## The story
A long time ago I built a Heavy Gear Blitz army construction application in Java called Blitz Commander. I also did the layout for several books from the Locked & Loaded version of the game. Unfortunately, my working relationship with DP9 ended before BlitzCommander was every fully finished. (I had to get a real job and afterwards I no longer had the time to devote to the project.)

Time went by and DP9 soldiered on. When they released the 3.0 version of the rules my interest was again piqued and I started following Heavy Gear Blitz again.

**Short version:** I thought it was finally time that I learn TypeScript and React but I needed a project to build. I couldn't think of a better project than to resurrect BlitzCommander and this time make it a web application.
